Jack and Jill are playing a string game. Jack has given Jill two strings A and B. Jill has to derive a string C from A, by deleting elements from string A, such that string C does not contain any element of string B. Jill needs help to do this task. She wants a program to do this as she is lazy. Given strings A and B as input, give string C as Output.

Example 1:

Input:
tiger     -> input string A
ti          -> input string B
Output:
ger       -> Output string C
Explanation:
After removing “t” and “i” from “tiger”, we are left with “ger”.
So, the answer is “ger”.

    {
       if(st.find(A[i])==st.end())
       C.push_back(A[i]);

    cin>>B;
    passstring(A,B);
    return 0;
