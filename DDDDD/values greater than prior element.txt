QUESTION:-> Given an integer array Arr of size N the task is to find the count of elements whose         
           value is greater than all of its prior elements.

           Note : 1st element of the array should be considered in the count of the result.

For example,

Arr[]={7,4,8,2,9}

As 7 is the first element, it will consider in the result.

8 and 9 are also the elements that are greater than all of its previous elements.

Since total of  3 elements is present in the array that meets the condition.

Hence the output = 3.

 Example 1:

Input 

5 -> Value of N, represents size of Arr

7-> Value of Arr[0]

4 -> Value of Arr[1]

8-> Value of Arr[2]

2-> Value of Arr[3]

9-> Value of Arr[4]

Output :

3

Example 2:

5   -> Value of N, represents size of Arr

3  -> Value of Arr[0]

4 -> Value of Arr[1]

5 -> Value of Arr[2]

8 -> Value of Arr[3]

9 -> Value of Arr[4]

Output : 

5
