There are n houses built in a line, each of which contains some value in it.

A thief is going to steal the maximal value of these houses, but he canâ€™t steal in two adjacent houses because the owner of the stolen houses will tell his two neighbours left and right side.

What is the maximum stolen value?

Input Format

First an integer n, denoting how many houses are there.
Then n space separated integers denoting the values for the n houses.
Output Format

An integer denoting the maximum value possible to steal.

Input                                          

7                                               

6 7 1 3 8 2 5

Output

20

Explanation

6+1+8+5 = 20.

It is the max possible value. #include <iostream>
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int n;
    int sum1=0,sum2=0;
    vector<int>v;
    cout<<"Enter the nuber of houses"<<endl;
    cin>>n;
    vector<int>arr(n);
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
    {
        cin>>arr[i];
    }
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
    {
        sum1+=arr[i];
        i++;
    }
    for(int i=1;i<n;i++)
    {
        sum2+=arr[i];
        i++;
    }
    v.push_back(sum1);
    v.push_back(sum2);
    int max=*max_element(v.begin(),v.end());
    cout<<"maximum number of house stolen by theif is "<<max;
    return 0;
} is this code right for above problem
